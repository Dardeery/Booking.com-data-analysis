# Booking.com-data-analysis


### Data exploration and session performance

First, I would explore the provided web-scrapped files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shehanaaljaloud/bookingcom) and understand the provided data.
in order to Get a feel for how it is structured, add describtion of what are most striking characteristics of Booking.com users and why these characteristics are important for the company.
Secondly, I add defintion of three KPIs for the performance of sessions on the website site and show their development over time, add Description of what developments might be happening.


### Product Strategy
Let’s imagine that Booking.com wants to introduce a new product called “Concerts near you”. This new product aims to provide information to the user about concerts and music events that will happen in nearby location (buying and reserving tickets is not a function that this product has). 
"Concerts near you" is an exciting opportunity for Booking.com to allow users to engage with our brand in a different way. It also means new challenges as this product is completely new and will require new ways to measure its success when comparing to our current “Accommodation search” product.


1. within this new product I would Define a new set of Key performance Indicators that we should use at Booking.com to measure the success of this new product. Be aware that this product means new
ways for the user to interact with our brand. Think carefully about how this new product brings value to the trivago brand from a strategic and market perspective.

2. within this new product I would highlight the top two countries this project could start in it, I would represent the best opportunity for such proof of concept based on analysis.
